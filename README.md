In the dynamic landscape of social media, Twitter serves as a vibrant hub where millions express their opinions, making it a rich corpus for sentiment analysis. This study aims to harness machine learning and deep learning techniques to scrutinize and classify sentiments of Twitter data, facilitating an understanding of public opinion dynamics. We conducted a comprehensive sentiment analysis using a well-established dataset, Sentiment140, which consists of 1.6 million tweets, each annotated with a sentiment polarity. Our approach involved a meticulous data preprocessing routine to clean and standardize tweets, enhancing the quality of the input data for model training. We employed a Logistic Regression model coupled with a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer, leveraging n-gram features to capture contextual nuances. This model was fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to determine the optimal hyperparameters, culminating in a cross-validation accuracy of 77.19%. In parallel, we developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to model the sequential nature of language in tweets, achieving a test accuracy of 76.77%. The LSTM model's ability to remember long-term dependencies makes it a powerful tool for the text classification tasks inherent in sentiment analysis. However, its performance in this context was slightly overshadowed by the Logistic Regression model, suggesting that simpler models can be equally or more effective for certain NLP tasks. An in-depth error analysis on the Logistic Regression model's output highlighted the challenges of sarcasm and nuanced language interpretation, shedding light on areas where the model could be improved. The research validates the practical application of traditional and neural network models in sentiment analysis, with implications for enhancing consumer insight strategies and real-time opinion mining. Our study thus contributes a dual perspective on the applicability of different analytical paradigms to the burgeoning field of social media analytics.
